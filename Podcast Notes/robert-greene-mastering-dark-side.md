1. Humans are animals and we tend to behave like the "humans" we call by overcoming the deep-rooted animal forces within us. Those forces are our emotions like envy, anger, jealousy, sadness.

2. We are not built to adapt to live in the technological era we are living in, right now.

3. We're brilliant social animals. We cooperate at such a level that no other type of animal can reach.

4. Humans constantly compare themselves to others and look for attention. We start off from childhood - getting jealous if a sibling gets more attention from parents. Social media completely exacerbates this tendency and that becomes a force of triggering envy in human nature.

5. Emotions are contagious.

6. People are so immersed in technology that they have forgotten how to understand people and their emotions.

7. The survival of modern day human beings depend upon how much we relate to each other.

8. Inability to understand the people we are dealing with, is a huge problem in modern society.

9. There is something deeply engraved in every human being which results in the formation of their character. There are characteristics which we cannot control that can come from DNA, relations, early attachments.

10. Interaction with other people affect how we look at ourselves.

11. We are a mystery to ourselves.

12. We don't always understand our emotions.

13. We don't examine our emotions or our ideas. We let them come and go.

14. Self-awareness starts with questioning your emotions and ideas.
	- "Why am I angry?"
	- "Where did this idea come from?"
	- "Why do I feel bored?"

15. Stop assuming that everything you do is right.

16. Self-awareness is a confrontation with reality.

17. Admit your faults. That's the first baby step for self-awareness.

18. Gestures, tone of voice, body posture make up the **second language** to understand human beings.

19. Humans have the ability to master this second language.

20. The deep emotions are expressed non-verbally, via the second language.

21. Accept things as they are, stop judging. View things positively.

22. Attitude towards other human beings will affect your own nature.

23. Amor Fati - "A Love For Fate". Accepting your fate and widening the scope of the activities you wanna do in life.

24. Life is what it is. Wishing for a better political system, people is anti-life.

25. Love fate. Fate is what you cannot control.

26. Our fear of death is the greatest influencer in our behaviour.

27. Realization about death really changes the perspective towards life.

28. The worst feeling in the world is to be facing death and to think "Damn I've wasted my life!".

29. If you want to affect other people. Do it to create an IMPACT rather than just entertaining or gaining attention.

30. Look at people as facts of nature. Accept them for who they are and you'll free yourself from all the emotional baggage that you carry by taking everything personally.
