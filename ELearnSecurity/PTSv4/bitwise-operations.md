# Bitwise Operations
------------------
## Description:

A computer can manipulate bits by bitwise operations. (Most commonly used in networking and assembly programming.)
	


## List of operations:

1. **NOT operation**

It flips the bits, converts 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.
Example: 1011 -> 0100

2. **AND operation**

It performs a logical AND between the bits of its operands (a variable or a constant value.)
If a bit in the same position is 1 then the result will be 1 else 0.
Example: 001110101 AND 000100011 = 000100001

3. **OR operation**

It performs logical OR between the bits of it operands.
If __atleast__ one of the comparing bits is 1 then the result would be 1.

Example: 1101 OR 0110 = 1111

4. **XOR operation**

It performs logical exclusive OR between the bits of its operands.

If __just one__ of the bits in comparing position is 1 then the result would be 1 else 0.

Example: 1101 XOR 0110 = 1011
